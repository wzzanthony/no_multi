The administration of the oath included several missteps, although conflicting news accounts abound about the exact sequence of events. According to one news report, as Roberts administered the first part of the presidential oath, he paused after saying "I, Barack Hussein Obama." As Obama began to repeat those words, Roberts continued on with the oath by reciting "do solemnly swear," interrupting the President. According to a different news report, it was Obama who interrupted Roberts during his recitation of the first part of the oath. [48] [49]
Following the completion of the first phrase of the presidential oath, Roberts recited the next part of the oath incorrectly, by stating, "that I will execute the Office of President the United States " (rather than "that I will execute the Office of President the United States"). Obama recited the words "I will execute," and then paused, apparently noticing the error, and looked at Roberts. Roberts then tried to correct his mistake in administering the oath by reciting "faithfully the Office of President of the United States." However, Obama repeated Roberts' first mistaken phrase.tofaithfullyfaithfullyof [50] [46]

A central theme of President Barack Obama's was a call to restore responsibility both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases; instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin. inaugural address [55] [56] [57]
Obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying, "we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents." The speech reinforced words such as "legacy" and "heritage," as well as values such as "honesty," "courage" and "patriotism," which "are old." Near the end of the speech, Obama referred to words written by in , which were ordered by to be read to his troops: "Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]." Because Obama's message focused on the need for change, Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as President within the margins of the nation's traditions.

As part of Obama's call for responsibility, he said "what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility a recognition, on the part of every American" and "those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account."
